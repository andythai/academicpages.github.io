Research
------
My research interests are relatively diverse and interdisciplinary.  
Topics I would like to explore include:
* Computer vision
* Computer graphics
  * Non-photorealistic rendering (NPR)  
* Computational cognitive models & machine learning  
  
In the past I have worked on studies relating to social robotics, animal-robot interaction, and pro-social reciprocity.
