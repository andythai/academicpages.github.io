Research
------
My research interests are relatively diverse. Topics I would like to explore include:  
* Computer vision
* Computer graphics
  * Non-photorealistic rendering (NPR)  
  * Computer animation  
* Computational cognitive models & machine learning  
  * Generative modeling  
  
In the past I have worked on studies relating to social robotics, animal-robot interaction, and pro-social reciprocity in rodents.
